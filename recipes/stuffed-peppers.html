    <h2 class="peppers-page subh">Description</h2>
    <p class="peppers-page description">This flavor packed recipe crams ground beef, rice and other supplementary ingredients inside of a bell pepper. 
        For me this is a special dish that reminds me of my family. 
        It was a spectacular night whenever my stepmother blessed us with stuffed peppers for dinner. 
        I hope that this delicious meal can be enjoyed by many more families.
